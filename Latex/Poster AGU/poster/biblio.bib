  abstract = {A cellular automaton is an iterative array of very simple identical
	information processing machines called cells. Each cell can communicate
	with neighboring cells. At discrete moments of time the cells can
	change from one state to another as a function of the states of the
	cell and its neighbors. Thus on a global basis, the collection of
	cells is characterized by some type of behavior. The goal of this
	investigation was to determine just how simple the individual cells
	could be while the global behavior achieved some specified criterion
	of complexity -- usually the ability to perform a computation or
	to reproduce some pattern. The chief result described in this thesis
	is that an array of identical square cells (in two dimensions), each
	cell of which communicates directly with only its four nearest edge
	neighbors and each of which can exist in only two states, can perform
	any computation. This computation proceeds in a straight forward
	way. A configuration is a specification of the states of all the
	cells in some area of the iterative array. Another result described
	in this thesis is the existence of a self-reproducing configuration
	in an array of four-state cells, a reduction of four states from
	the previously known eight-state case. The technique of information
	processing in cellular arrays involves the synthesis of some basic
	components. Then the desired behaviors are obtained by the interconnection
	of these components. A chapter on components describes some sets
	of basic components. Possible applications of the results of this
	investigation, descriptions of some interesting phenomena (for vanishingly
	small cells), and suggestions for further study are given later.},

  abstract = {The notion of reversibility has been intensively studied in the field
	of cellular automata (CA), for several reasons. However, a related
	notion found in physical theories has been so far neglected, not
	only in CA, but generally in discrete dynamical systems. This is
	the notion of time-symmetry, which refers to the inability of distinguishing
	between backward and forward time directions. Here we formalize it
	in the context of CA, and study some of its basic properties. We
	also show how some well-known \{CA\} fit into the class of time-symmetric
	CA, and provide a number of results on the relation between this
	and other classes of CA. The existence of an intrinsically universal
	time-symmetric \{CA\} within the class of reversible \{CA\} is proved.
	Finally, we show the undecidability of time-symmetry for \{CA\} of
	dimension 2 or higher, even within the class of reversible CA. The
	case of dimension 1 is one of several open questions discussed in
	the conclusions.},
