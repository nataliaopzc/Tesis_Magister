abstract="Cellular Automata have been used since their introduction as a discrete tool of modelization. In many of the physical processes one may modelize thus (such as bootstrap percolation, forest fire or epidemic propagation models, life without death, etc), each local change is irreversible. The class of freezing Cellular Automata (FCA) captures this feature. In a freezing cellular automaton the states are ordered and the cells can only decrease their state according to this ``freezing-order''.",

  Abstract                 = {A cellular automaton is an iterative array of very simple identical information processing machines called cells. Each cell can communicate with neighboring cells. At discrete moments of time the cells can change from one state to another as a function of the states of the cell and its neighbors. Thus on a global basis, the collection of cells is characterized by some type of behavior. The goal of this investigation was to determine just how simple the individual cells could be while the global behavior achieved some specified criterion of complexity -- usually the ability to perform a computation or to reproduce some pattern. The chief result described in this thesis is that an array of identical square cells (in two dimensions), each cell of which communicates directly with only its four nearest edge neighbors and each of which can exist in only two states, can perform any computation. This computation proceeds in a straight forward way. A configuration is a specification of the states of all the cells in some area of the iterative array. Another result described in this thesis is the existence of a self-reproducing configuration in an array of four-state cells, a reduction of four states from the previously known eight-state case. The technique of information processing in cellular arrays involves the synthesis of some basic components. Then the desired behaviors are obtained by the interconnection of these components. A chapter on components describes some sets of basic components. Possible applications of the results of this investigation, descriptions of some interesting phenomena (for vanishingly small cells), and suggestions for further study are given later.},

  Abstract                 = {Number-conserving cellular automata (NCCA) are particularly interesting, both because of their natural appearance as models of real systems, and because of the strong restrictions that number-conservation implies. Here we extend the definition of the property to include cellular automata with any set of states in Z, and show that they can be always extended to â€œusualâ€� \{NCCA\} with contiguous states. We show a way to simulate any one dimensional \{CA\} through a one-dimensional NCCA, proving the existence of intrinsically universal NCCA. Finally, we give an algorithm to decide, given a CA, if its states can be labeled with integers to produce a NCCA, and to find this relabeling if the answer is positive. },

These are equivalent, for a restricted set of initial conditions, to non-zero probability transitions in single spin-flip dynamics of the Ising model at zero temperature. We show that in three or more dimensions these systems can simulate Boolean circuits of AND and OR gates, and are therefore P-complete. That is, predicting their state t time-steps in the future is at least as hard as any other problem that takes polynomial time on a serial computer. Therefore, unless a widely believed conjecture in computer science is false, it is impossible even with parallel computation to predict majority-vote cellular automata, or zero-temperature single spin-flip Ising dynamics, qualitatively faster than by explicit simulation.},

  abstract = {A new percolation problem is posed which can exhibit a first-order transition. In bootstrap percolation, sites on an empty lattice are first randomly occupied, and then all occupied sites with less than a given number m of occupied neighbours are successively removed until a stable configuration is reached. On any lattice for sufficiently large m, the ensuing clusters can only be infinite. On a Bethe lattice for m>or=3, the fraction of the lattice occupied by infinite clusters discontinuously jumps from zero at the percolation threshold. From an analysis of stable and metastable ground states of the dilute Blume-Capel model (1966), it is concluded that effects like bootstrap percolation may occur in some real magnets.},

An algorithm has been constructed based on the proposed model and was used for the determination of fire fronts in a number of hypothetical forests, which were found to be in good agreement with the experience on fire spreading in real forests.},
